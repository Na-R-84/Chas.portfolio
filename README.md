### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Your website should be compatible with modern browsers and work reasonably well in any browser that is no older than three years
- Your HTML code must be correct when it comes to semantics (e.g. no layout through tables or completely illogical heading levels) and use semantic tags such as <nav>
- The CSS code should be in a separate file
- Good naming in English in all classes.
- When the button for more information is clicked, a modal popup should appear with a little more information about the project. This should not require JavaScript but only be built with HTML & CSS.
- Add a print CSS that makes printing the page look nice
- Work with CSS animations
- Build the page in a light and a dark version that is automatically switched on, only with CSS


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Scss
