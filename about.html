                <h4>Who am I ? </h4>
                <p>Electronic engineering was my first major in university.The reason for selecting this was that I have always had a passion for computers since I was a child, which led me to this field. I have always been keenly interested in technology, so I decided to study it further. After my studies at the university, I found a job that was relevant to my major. I worked as a tester and electrical designer. </p>
                <p>My journey into the world of programmering started when my husband decided to start his own business and needed a website. It was at this point that I challenged myself to build a website for his company. This experience ignited my passion for software development, a passion that has grown stronger during my studies.</p>
                <p>I enjoy facing challenges and meeting new people. I am passionate about finding the best solutions, leading projects and teams, and caring about client needs. I still spend hours learning new things and solving different problems. appreciate receiving feedback on my work, working in a team, and learning new techniques or helping others. I believe motivation can be contagious within a group, and I strive to make life easier.</p>
